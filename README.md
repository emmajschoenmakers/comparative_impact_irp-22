## Abstract 

More than 40% of the worldâ€™s urban population lives in coastal habitats and are increasingly exposed to cyclones following the rising impacts of climate change. However, there is still insufficient information available for the streamlined remotely sensed assessment of impacts of tropical cyclones on coastal habitats, particularly in the Mozambique Channel. Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data along with socio-ecological parameters including mangrove forest health and population density, we modelled the extent of flooding and its impact following the â€˜severe tropical stormâ€™ Ana which occurred between the 20th January until 25th January over the Mozambique Channel in Madagascar and Mozambique. Focusing on regions hit by Ana, namely the Sofala and Zambezia regions and the Boeny and Melaky provinces in Mozambique and Madagascar respectively, we adapted a model by the UN-SPIDER to effectively assess storm and cyclone impacts at a resolution of up to 10m. 


## Repository Structure

- [Reports](https://github.com/ese-msc-2021/irp-ejs21/tree/main/reports) : including presentation slides, final report and project plan.
- [Info](https://github.com/ese-msc-2021/irp-ejs21/tree/main/info) : including admin information, IRP title, and supervisors.
- [Tools](https://github.com/ese-msc-2021/irp-ejs21/tree/main/tools) : including testing and CI files.
- [Images](https://github.com/ese-msc-2021/irp-ejs21/tree/main/pictures) : including high resolution output images, repo images, images and tables from the irp report, and presentation pictures.
- [Scripts](https://github.com/ese-msc-2021/irp-ejs21/tree/main/scripts) : including graph scripts, classification and model scripts (Python, JavaScript)

## User Instructions

The majority of the code, apart from those requiring external datasets such the landcover and population impact assessment, can be run in [Google Earth Engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) and can be reproducible to any area of interest by changing the area of interest (aoi). This also includes immediate visualisation of storm-related flooding statistics and impact.  
Note that further data visualisation was produced in Python and QGIS and not available on GEE directly. It is up to the end-user if they wish to do so after exporting the models to Drive for example.

For optional Python data visualisation:
In the terminal, go to the file path containing the ``environment.yml`` file.
Next run the commands:
``conda env create -f environment.yml``

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Follow the prompts given by the terminal
